# Good

1.  You're responsible for code quality.
2.  Use meaningful names.
3.  Write code that expresses intent.
4.  Code should speak for itself. Less comments = less maintenance.
5.  Leave the code better than you found it.
6.  Single-responsibility code. i.e function does 1 thing well. Less arguments = better function. classes: most methods use most of the class' properties.
7.  Tests (TDD).
8.  Work on big picture skeleton, then fill in the details later  (interface first, implementation later).
9.  Independent components that can be used in different places.
10. Master your craft.
